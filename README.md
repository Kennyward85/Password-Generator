# Password-Generator 

Creating a Password generator 
This will take in selections based off prompts
It will be able to generate the password based off of the selection.

It will check for length of password the user wants must be greater than 8 less than 128  the options will be uppercase chars, lowercase chars, numbers, and symbols

Based off the selection it will randomize what it chooses and populate a password for the user.

Added a onclick function to go ahead and remove the old password to create another one they were populating on top of the old passwords before this.
